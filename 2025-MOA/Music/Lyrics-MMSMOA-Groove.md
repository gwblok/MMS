### MMSMOA Groove

#### Verse 1
Down in Minnesota, where the techies all convene,
MMSMOA’s the summit, it’s the IT dream scene.
At the Radisson Blu, by the Mall of America’s glow,
Systems management pros come to learn and grow.
Task sequences, ConfigMgr, Intune in the air,
With expert speakers sharin’ knowledge everywhere.
From deep-dive sessions to the tips and tricks we crave,
MMSMOA’s the place where IT pros are brave.

The welcome reception’s poppin’ on a Sunday night,
Networking with MVPs, yeah, the vibe’s just right.
No formal closin’ party, but the sponsors bring the fun,
Booth parties, happy hours, ‘til the night is done.
With a hundred sessions, from level 100 to 500 deep,
We’re geekin’ out on endpoints, no time for sleep.
Midwest Management Summit, you’re the heart of the game,
MMSMOA, we’re shoutin’ your name!

#### Chorus
Oh, MMSMOA Groove, you light up the tech world bright,
Four days of learnin’, networkin’ through the night.
With sponsors like PatchMyPC, 2Pint, and NiCE too,
They’re powerin’ the summit, makin’ dreams come true.
From the Mall of America to the sessions we roam,
MMSMOA, you feel like home.
Groove to the rhythm of the IT flow,
MMSMOA, let’s go, let’s go!

#### Verse 2
Let’s give a shout to PatchMyPC, they’re patchin’ with flair,
Third-party updates for ConfigMgr, Intune, everywhere.
At their booth, it’s a party, spinnin’ wheels for swag,
Advanced Insights reporting, makin’ IT pros brag.
From auto-patching to seamless app deploy,
PatchMyPC’s at MMS, bringin’ IT joy.
Their kickoff at The Fair, with go-karts and cheers,
Sponsors like PatchMyPC make memories for years.

2Pint Software’s rockin’, with their bandwidth-saving groove,
Nomad and RBA, makin’ content moves.
Brewery Tour sponsors, they’re the crowd’s delight,
Bus rides to Wabasha, brews under starlight.
From PXE Everywhere to endpoint dreams they share,
2Pint’s at MMSMOA, showin’ they care.
Their t-shirts and swag keep the summit alive,
2Pint Software, helpin’ IT thrive.

#### Chorus
Oh, MMSMOA Groove, you light up the tech world bright,
Four days of learnin’, networkin’ through the night.
With sponsors like PatchMyPC, 2Pint, and NiCE too,
They’re powerin’ the summit, makin’ dreams come true.
From the Mall of America to the sessions we roam,
MMSMOA, you feel like home.
Groove to the rhythm of the IT flow,
MMSMOA, let’s go, let’s go!

#### Bridge
NiCE and Kelverion, they’re the SCOM/SCORCH crew,
Automated monitoring, makin’ IT dreams come true.
Live demos at their booth, showin’ best practices clear,
With expert talks and insights, they’re the ones we cheer.
Cyber Advisors in the mix, with their tech know-how,
Bloggin’ ‘bout the summit, keepin’ us wowed.
Community-driven, capped at 750 strong,
Intimate and focused, where we all belong.

Beer sessions at five, with a happy hour vibe,
SharTips and NoF, where ideas come alive.
Microsoft product teams, they’re joinin’ the fray,
Feedback loops at MMS, improvin’ every day.
Sponsors throw the parties, from axe-throwing to brews,
Networkin’ with peers, sharin’ IT views.
They fund the swag, like jackets for the cold,
Light and comfy, keepin’ us bold.

#### Verse 3
The Mall’s right next door, with attractions galore,
But the real thrill’s the knowledge we explore.
Red-jacket speakers, like Garth Jones and Dave,
Droppin’ ConfigMgr wisdom, makin’ us brave.
Camping sessions, one-on-one with the best,
Solvin’ real-world problems, puttin’ skills to the test.
From OSD to autopilot, we’re pushin’ the edge,
MMSMOA’s the spark for our IT pledge.

Sponsors keep it rollin’, with their booths full of flair,
PatchMyPC and 2Pint, they’re the stars we compare.
They’re not just vendors, they’re part of the crew,
Buildin’ the future with the MMS crew.
From early bird tickets to the final day’s cheer,
The summit’s affordable, knowledge crystal clear.
MMSMOA, you’re the beat of our heart,
With sponsors and tech, we’ll never part.

#### Chorus
Oh, MMSMOA Groove, you light up the tech world bright,
Four days of learnin’, networkin’ through the night.
With sponsors like PatchMyPC, 2Pint, and NiCE too,
They’re powerin’ the summit, makin’ dreams come true.
From the Mall of America to the sessions we roam,
MMSMOA, you feel like home.
Groove to the rhythm of the IT flow,
MMSMOA, let’s go, let’s go!

#### Outro
So raise a glass to MMS, where the techies unite,
From the sessions to the parties, we’re geekin’ with delight.
